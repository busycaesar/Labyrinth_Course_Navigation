# Autonomous Navigation

## Description
This project features RobotC code designed to enable a robot to autonomously navigate through a predefined course. Starting from the initial tile, the robot uses its sensors to measure and analyze environmental values, determining the path to reach the end tile. The robot dynamically decides which direction to move at each step, effectively figuring out the correct route through the course. This intelligent navigation system allows the robot to handle various course layouts and successfully reach its destination.

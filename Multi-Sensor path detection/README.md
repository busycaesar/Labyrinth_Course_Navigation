# Multi-Sensor Path Detection

## Description
This project contains RobotC code that enables a robot to autonomously follow a black line on a map using line-tracking sensors. As the robot navigates the path, it continuously adjusts its movement to stay aligned with the line. Upon reaching the end of the line and detecting a wall in front, the robot initiates a controlled deceleration, ensuring a smooth reduction in speed. This deceleration is designed to produce a linear slowdown graph, providing a gradual stop rather than a sudden halt.
